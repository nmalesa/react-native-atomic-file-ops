# react-native-atomic-file-ops

Atomically writing to a file on mobile avoids potential file corruption.  When writing atomically, the data is first written to a separate auxiliary file.  Once writing is successful, the auxiliary file is renamed to the path specified by the application.  When writing is not done atomically, the data is written directly to the path.  Writing atomically guarantees that the path and its data will not be corrupted even if a crash occurs during writing.

In our React Native app, we encountered a bug with Android 10 in which writing to an existing file corrupted that file.  If the existing data was longer than the new data, rather than completely overwriting the existing file, the app wrote the new, truncated data while keeping any remaining original data, leading to data corruption.  For example, if the original file contained the string ‚Äúbootstrapping‚Äù and the new data to be written is the string ‚Äúbyte‚Äù, the file would be written as ‚Äúbytestrapping‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbyte‚Äù.  This behavior was caused by writing data directly to the path without an atomic ‚Äúsafety check.‚Äù

No open source file systems libraries available for React Native supported writing to files atomically.  We built `react-native-atomic-file-ops` in order to prevent corruption when writing to files.  By writing atomically to an auxiliary file first and making sure that file has been written successfully, `react-native-atomic-file-ops` protects the file path and its data.

## Installation

While this library was initially built to fix a bug occurring on a specific version of Android, it supports both Android and iOS.

```sh
npm install react-native-atomic-file-ops
```

For iOS:
```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

## How to Use

```js
import AtomicFileOps from "react-native-atomic-file-ops";

// ...

// EXAMPLE:  Writes to a text file
await AtomicFileOps.writeFile('Cats.txt', 'üò∏üòπüò∫üòª', 'UTF8')

// EXAMPLE:  Writes to a JSON file
const fileName = 'CavyImageMetadata.json'

const imageMetadata = [
  {
    title: 'Sasu the Guinea Pig',
    alt: 'Guinea pig in green grass with dandelions',
    creator: 'andymiccone',
    url: 'https://live.staticflickr.com/7377/26722155994_5200abc340_b.jpg',
    license: 'CC0 1.0'
  }
]

const unicode = 'UTF8'

await AtomicFileOps.writeFile(fileName, JSON.stringify(imageMetadata), unicode)
```

## API

### ```writeFile(filePath: String, data: String, options: String)```
Writes the `data` atomically to the `filePath`. `options` allows for following encoded character sets:  `utf8`, `ascii`, or `base64`.

## Example App

This library includes an example app showing how `react-native-atomic-file-ops` can be used to fix corrupted files.  See the example app‚Äôs documentation for information on running the app and its tests.

## Tests

The `writeFile` API has been tested in both Java (link to tests for Android) and Swift (link to tests for iOS).  Scenarios tested include:
* Writing JSON to a file
* Overwriting an existing file with truncated data
* Providing `writeFile` with a corrupted character set
* Providing `writeFile` with a corrupted file path

Additionally, the library has been tested on React Native in an example app using Cavy (link to tests for React Native).  See the example app‚Äôs documentation for information on running Cavy tests.

## Contributing

`react-native-atomic-file-ops` is open-source.  If you find a bug or have an idea to improve this module, please open an issue.
