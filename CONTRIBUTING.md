# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to react-native-atomic-file-ops!  We love your input, and we want to make contributing to our open source library easy and transparent.

There are many ways to contribute. Examples include:

- Improving the documentation
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix or new feature

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). We welcome newcomers and encourage diverse contributors from all backgrounds. Please make sure you are friendly and respectful in all of our spaces.

## Reporting a Bug

We use [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) to track bugs. Report a bug by opening a GitHub Issue. Label the issue as `bug`.

Write detailed bug reports that provide background information and sample code. Great bug reports should have:

* A brief summary that provides context
  * How are you using the project?
  * What version of the project are you using?
  * How is your environment set up?
* Steps to reproduce the bug
  * Be specific! What did you do step-by-step?
  * Provide reproducible sample code if possible.
* What you expected to happen
* What actually happened
* Notes
  * What solutions did you already try that didn't work?
  * Why do you think this problem is happening?

## Submitting a Pull Request

We welcome your pull requests!

We use [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), and pull requests are the best way to propose code changes.

1.  Fork the repo, and create your branches from `main`. Your branch name should describe the change you are making.
2.  Run the project's tests according to its documentation. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it is great to know that you have a clean slate.
3.  Make all code changes in your fork.
4.  Add tests for your changes. Only documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding a new feature or fixing a bug, we need a test! Make sure your tests pass.
5.  Update the documentation as needed.
6.  Make sure your code lints.
7.  Commit your changes.
8.  Push to your fork, and submit your pull request. Please provide us with some explanation of why you made your changes. For new features, make sure to explain a standard use case.

**Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request).

## Requesting a Feature

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that does not exist in this project, you are probably not alone! Other users may have similar needs.

Open a GitHub Issue that describes the feature you would like to see, why it is important to include in the project, and how it should work. Your idea should fit within the scope and aims of the project and be useful to the majority of our users. Please provide as much detail and context as possible. Label the issue as `enhancement`.

### Code Review

Your pull request will be reviewed by the core maintainers of the project. Your code will be checked to make sure it works as intended, handles edge cases, has no obvious vulnerabilities, scales well, and includes tests and documentation as needed. Please make sure your code is readable: provide comments, and use clear function and variable names. Your code should be easy to understand by people who have never worked on it before.

If an issue is found during the review, the reviewers will provide feedback about the issue and request that you modify your pull request.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license that covers the project.
